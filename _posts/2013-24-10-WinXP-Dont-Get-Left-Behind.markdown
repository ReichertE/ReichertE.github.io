**Abstract**

When Chaucer said that all good things must come to an end, he undoubtedly was not referring to Windows XP’s end of life. However, as XP has just passed 12 years of existence, there are plenty of IT directors and CIOs that would still claim the parallel exists, since support is scheduled to end in April 2014. As punny as the topic can be portrayed, the sunset of such a beloved operating system is not humorous to those who standardized. With its departure, current users will lose their continued support, inclusive of security patches, hotfixes, and bug fixes, which kept everything running smoothly. Licensed computers might soon be portrayed as potential vulnerabilities and threats to the processes and applications that they control, which in turn could lead to a mass exodus of XP users. Since data from Net Applications, a web analytics firm, shows that 31.6 percent of users are still on this platform as of October 2013,1 the topic is fuming with speculation as to whether or not corporations should make the switch and whether or not this end of life (EOL) is of concern to them. While no one expects that come April 9, they will walk into their factories and experience immediate downtime and attacks, those that have standardized on the platform realize that the threat is imminent nonetheless. Leading up to this event, there will be both those making the argument for the upgrade, as well as those opposing it. This white paper will highlight both schools of thought and the role a supplier could play in either scenario.

**Afflicted Users**

Since customers that have industrial PCs need to
manage multiple lifecycles when maintaining their
systems, they have to ensure that drivers are up-todate
based on chipset revisions, hard drives aren’t
nearing end of life, and many other subtleties that could
ultimately lead to downtime during their process. A
particular worry is the security holes that can develop
in their system when it is attached to a public network.
Contrary to a private network, where computers aren’t
connected to the outside world via the Internet, public
networks are vulnerable to hackers and viruses. These
kinds of vulnerabilities are what causes administrators
to apply security patches and take additional measures,
such as the Phoenix Contact mGuard security device,
to ensure their cyber security. However, in order for
security patches to be released, the operating system
needs to still be under support by Microsoft.
Back in 2002, Microsoft released a Support Lifecycle
policy that offered more transparency to its end
consumers. The policy stated that Windows products
would receive a minimum of 10 years of support, with
five years mainstream and the other five extended
support. Due to this transparency, customers could
plan accordingly and upgrade their systems to the
successor, allowing them to receive security patches
on the upgraded system.
Based upon the aforementioned data, some would
argue that only computers connected to the outside
world (i.e., the Internet) would be afflicted and be
candidates for change. However, even networks not
attached to the Internet run the risk of being exploited
remotely. In the case of Windows XP, best practice
is to switch to a succeeding version such as Win 7
or Win 8.
Since Microsoft notes that the average enterprise
deployment can take 18 to 32 months, urgency
depends upon the potential risk XP users are willing
to endure. For users on networks connected to the
Internet, the urgency to beat the April 8 deadline is
formidable. For customers that need to make the
switch but are unable to by April 8, certain suppliers
have the ability to still sell licenses after the April 8
deadline, but there will still be no patches/support. The
extension should also allow companies that are late on
their switch to allocate the funding and resources

**Two Trains of thought**

*It's not broken, so don't fix it*

To those that find XP’s end of life a moot point due to
an “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it” mentality, realize that
by not taking action, you are preventing future action.
If your company abides by a Kaizen strategy, where
there is momentum toward continual improvement,
realize that changing the computer image could be
an extremely sensitive matter, as you would need
to ensure that you don’t expose yourself to new
vulnerabilities and threats. Presumably, most users that
would continue to use XP after the EOL would not be
on an open network subject to outside threats, but if
that were to ever change, there would be an imminent
threat of attacks.
A new theme within the control segment is this exact
concept, known as future-proofing, where a company
makes decisions today that could potentially impact
decisions a few years from now. While this theme could
more easily be exhibited with a computer feature, such
as multi-touch, it is still just as applicable with operating
systems. However, we understand that continual
improvement isn’t necessarily a key performance
indicator, and there are costs, support, and uncertainty
paired with such an upgrade. The question at that
point becomes whether or not the current stability
outweighs the future potential of added functionality,
efficiencies and long-term cost savings.

While some would argue that attackers would spend
their time focusing on systems representative of the
majority of users, according to Net Applications, WIN
XP users still represent a staggering 31.6 percent of
users as of October 2013. While the United States
only has 16.2% still using this platform, other prominent
countries in the tech world, such as China, have a gutwrenching
72.1 percent. Assuming that these numbers
are considerable enough for attackers worldwide,
it is only a matter of time before vulnerabilities are
discovered. (Figure 1)
One might ask how they are discovered so quickly. It is
actually in part by the work produced by the Microsoft
Security Response Center (MSRC). Although seemingly
backwards, since the MSRC’s intention is to secure the
systems they support, each release of an update leads
the way for hackers to discover where they should
focus their efforts next.

Since MSRC patches both reactively and proactively,
each update is an opportunity for attackers to reverseengineer
the fixes to see where potential vulnerabilities
once were. Due to the fact that unsupported platforms
never received the packages, the reverse engineering
allows an entryway into all systems that have passed
their security update sunset.
While the obvious solution might be to upgrade to a
newer operating system, sometimes one simply can’t,
due to the significant costs and interruptions. Software
upgrades within an operating production network
commonly encounter unintended and unanticipated
consequences.
Another viable alternative solution is to use distributed
security appliances, such as those based on Phoenix
Contact’s mGuard technology. Those hardware
firewalls/routers protect non-patchable legacy systems
on the network. In addition, they can be easily installed
by plant-floor technicians without interrupting
production, plus they can be configured and launched
from a central server console. The resulting advantage
is a low-cost hardening of these systems by a simple
and transparent installation of plug-and-play modules
wherever required.
With mGuard CIFS Integrity Monitoring, Phoenix
Contact offers an industry-suitable solution to protect
Windows-based automation components against
malware and malicious attacks. To achieve this, mGuard
Integrity Monitoring supervises file systems against
unexpected modifications or additions to programs,
dynamic link libraries, and other executable code
without utilizing virus patterns – thus eliminating the
need for their permanent update. This innovation can
even detect damages from zero-day exploits for which
virus patterns don’t even exist yet.


*Who, how, what, when, where!*

The second school of thought does not deal with
whether or not a corporation should make the
switch, but rather how they will perform the switch.
While the majority of this plan needs to be based on
a case-by-case basis, there are several common
underlying rules that companies can follow to best
structure their switch.

First and foremost, they should make sure that the
supplier they are using to convert their units is able
to offer WIN XP licenses past the sunset date. Since
it takes nearly a year and a half for most corporations
to make the switch, they would want to make sure
that in the interim there are still methods to fulfill
their current business model until everything is set
in place for the upgraded units. Otherwise, on top
of the upgrade expenses there would be additional
opportunity cost from the lost business.
When everything is in place for the upgrade
process to begin, it makes the most sense to outline
a schedule for the implementation of upgraded units.
This schedule will be contingent upon how many
units can be installed in any given week. This number
should be conservative, as it doesn’t make sense to
have units sitting on the shelf. Only under extreme
circumstances would a customer want to purchase
the units up front, they might need to make additional
changes that were unbeknownst until that moment.
It’s also important to note that industrial PCs generally
have limited warranties, so in order to receive the
maximum warranty they would need to be put into
use immediately.
By staging the implementation and purchasing through
a supplier with extended license support, companies
are able to control a situation that easily could have
become volatile without the proper attention to detail.

**Conclusion**

Now is the time to plan ahead and to start futureproofing
your industrial PC. Without extended support
or a feasible downgrade path, you can potentially
expose your IPC – and worse yet, your entire business
– to security risks that far outweigh the cost of an OS
upgrade. If your IPC hardware is no longer state-ofthe-art,
it might make sense to replace the outdated
hardware with a new, better-performing, energyefficient
IPC, switch to a newer OS, and upgrade your
security system with the latest mGuard technology.
Not only will the new hardware enhance productivity,
it will also safeguard you from unwanted downtime due
to security breaches.
