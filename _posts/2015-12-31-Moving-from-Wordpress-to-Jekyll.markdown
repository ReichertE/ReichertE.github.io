post_description: This blog post contains the main reasons I jumped the proverbial "wordpress" ship. I'm going to type a lot of information to see if it will break on its own or whether or not I have to manually add the break, I'm just curious more than anything at this point in time.

As I was going over my budget for 2016, I was looking at some of my fixed costs each year. One item that came front and center was my hosting allocation which spread out over the year is $107.88 ($8.99/mo). In the past I had considered looking for alternative vendors ^I was currently using GoDaddy but it was something that I had read on a blog post (link Stammy post here) that truly sparked my interest.

By switching my blog from the Wordpress CMS to Jekyll, I'd be accomplishing a few things :

1) Gaining a few skills
    --Git/GitHub
    --Markdown
2)
