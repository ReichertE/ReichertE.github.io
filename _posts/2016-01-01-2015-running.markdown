title: Running Year in Review
date: 2016-01-01
post_description: I started running again somewhat seriously in April this past year. It might have been sparked by purchasing a watch, but it was certainly maintained do to the addition of a new track club. Motivation has been tough the past few years without a group of people to force you out the door each day. Oh how times are changing!
