**Hi, welcome to my website.** I'm an alumnus of <a href="http://www.etown.edu/">Elizabethtown College</a> with a degree in International Business and Marketing. I recently completed my MBA from [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu) while working for <a href="http://www.phoenixcontact.com/usa_home/"> Phoenix Contact</a> as a Product Manager for Ethernet. The thoughts expressed on this site are my own.
